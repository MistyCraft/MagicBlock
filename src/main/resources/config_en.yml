# Magic Block Properties

# Default usage times for Magic Blocks obtained through the /mb get command.
# ✅ Hot-reloadable: Changes take effect immediately with /mb reload

# Whether to enable the block binding system
# If set to true, players can bind blocks to themselves and retrieve them later
# If set to false, the binding system will be disabled and blocks won't be bound to players
# ⚠️ Requires restart: Core system feature that affects plugin initialization
enable-binding-system: true

# Whether to allow other players to use blocks that are bound to another player
# If set to true, players can use blocks even if they are bound to someone else

# ✅ Hot-reloadable: Changes take effect immediately with /mb reload
allow-use-bound-blocks: false

# Whether to remove the magic block when its uses are depleted
# If set to true, the block will be removed from the player's inventory and bound list when uses reach 0

# Shop Plugin Integration
