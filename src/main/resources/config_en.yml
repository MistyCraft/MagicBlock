enable-binding-system: true

# Whether to allow other players to use blocks that are bound to another player
# If set to true, players can use blocks even if they are bound to someone else

# CAUTION: Please be cautious when adding the following types of blocks to the ALLOWED blocks list!

#
# Typical examples include, but are not limited to:
#   - Redstone Dust (redstone_wire)
